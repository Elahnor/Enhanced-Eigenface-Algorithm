            This system enhances the Eigenface Algorithm to improve the identification of
            spoofing attacks in facial recognition. By addressing key challenges such as 
            the identification of face occlusions and spoofed images, the system
            significantly increases accuracy and reliability.

            It employs super resolution to effectively manage noise in the covariance matrix, ensuring 
            robust performance even with low-resolution images. Additionally, the system
            incorporates distance-adjustment features to account for varying facial
            distances from the camera, reducing the risk of misidentification and
            improving usability. Ultimately, this innovative approach strengthens the
            security and effectiveness of facial recognition technology.
